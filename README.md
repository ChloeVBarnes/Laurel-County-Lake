# Laurel-County-Lake
This is a repository submission for lab 07. 

This is a map created to visualize the Laurel County Lake. In the top right corner, a small area of town is shown with several buildings. This map was also created to illustrate the unique landforms around this lake in an aerial view. There is a visible line thorugh the map going diagonally down from the west to the south east, and this line represents telephone lines. Trees were taken down in a main made path, and it fairly wide, so it easily seen from the aerial view.
